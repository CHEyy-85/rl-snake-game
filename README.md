# Reinforcement Learning Snake Game

## Overview
This project implements a custom Snake game with a reinforcement learning agent trained using Deep Q-Learning (DQN) with TensorFlow. The agent learns to navigate the Snake game environment, optimizing its moves to maximize rewards.

## Features
- Custom Snake game built in Python.
- Deep Q-Network (DQN) implemented with TensorFlow.
- Target Q-Network for stable training.
- Experience replay for efficient learning.
- Soft updates to target Q-Network to stabilize training.
